<h2 class="Gh1">About</h2>
<p class="Gh2">Geisha (芸者) (/ˈɡeɪʃə/; Japanese: [ɡeːɕa]), also known as geiko (芸子) (in Kyoto and Kanazawa) or geigi (芸妓), are a class of female Japanese performing artists and entertainers trained in traditional Japanese performing arts styles, such as dance, music and singing, as well as being proficient conversationalists and hosts.
  Their distinct appearance is characterised by long, trailing kimono, traditional hairstyles and oshiroi make-up.
  Geisha entertain at parties known as ozashiki, often for the entertainment of wealthy clientele, as well as performing on stage and at festivals.
<br>
The arts that geisha perform are considered highly developed and, in some cases, unique throughout Japan to the world of geisha.
For example, the Gion district of Kyoto is the only district wherein the kyo-mai style of Japanese traditional dance is taught.
This style of dance is taught solely to the geisha within the district by the Inoue school, with the school's former head, Inoue Yachiyo V, having been classified as a "Living National Treasure" by the Government of Japan, the highest artistic award attainable in the country, in 1955.

<p class="Gh3">A geisha's appearance changes symbolically throughout her career, representing her training and seniority.
  These constitute changes in hairstyle, hair accessories, and kimono style.
  Makeup
  Both maiko and geisha wear traditional white foundation known as oshiroi; in the past, this white makeup - formerly made with lead - would have illuminated the face of a geisha when the only lighting available was that of candlelight.
  Oshiroi is worn with red and black eye and eyebrow makeup, red lips and light pink blusher. Both maiko and geisha underpaint their lips with a red lipstick known as beni, but first-year apprentice geisha paint only the lower lip, and wear less black around the eyes and eyebrows than senior maiko.
  Younger apprentices may also paint their eyebrows slightly shorter or rounder to emphasise a youthful appearance.
  Maiko wear noticeably more blush – known as tonoko – than geisha.
  Young apprentices may have the mother of the house or their "older sister" mentors help them apply makeup.
  Geisha wear more black around the eyes and eyebrows than maiko, and older geisha tend only to wear a full face of traditional white makeup during stage performances or on special occasions; older geisha generally stop wearing oshiroi around the same time they stop wearing hikizuri to parties.
  For a short period before becoming a geisha, maiko in some geisha districts colour their teeth black, usually accompanied by wearing the sakkō hairstyle and a decorated black formal kimono.
  Teeth blackening was once a common practice amongst married women in Japan and the imperial court in earlier times, but is now an extremely uncommon practice.
  Dress
  Geisha and maiko always wear kimono while working, and typically wear kimono outside of work.
  However, the type of kimono varies based on age, occasion, region and season of the year.
  Hair
  The hairstyles of geisha have varied throughout history.
  During the 17th century, the shimada hairstyle developed, which became the basis for the hairstyles worn by both geisha and maiko.
  When the profession of geisha first came into existence, dress edicts prevented geisha from wearing the dramatic hairstyles worn by courtesans, leading to the subdued nature of most geisha hairstyles.
  Following World War II, many of the hairstylists who had previously served the karyūkai no longer operated, leading to the redevelopment of hairstyles for geisha and maiko.
  Geisha, unable to reliably book in with a hairstylist once a week to maintain their hair, began to wear human hair wigs in the shimada style that required restyling far less.
  The hairstyles of maiko, still utilising the apprentice's own hair, became wider, placed higher upon the head, and shorter in length.
  There are five different hairstyles that a maiko wears, which mark the different stages of her apprenticeship.
  The nihongami hairstyle with kanzashi hair ornaments are most closely associated with maiko, who spend hours each week at the hairdresser and sleep on special pillows (takamakura) to preserve the elaborate styling.
  Maiko can develop a bald spot on their crown caused by the stress of wearing these hairstyles almost every day, but in the present day, this is less likely to happen due to the later age at which maiko begin their apprenticeship.
  Maiko in certain districts of Kyoto may also wear additional, differing hairstyles in the run up to graduating as a geisha.
  In the present day, geisha wear a variety of the shimada known as the chū taka shimada – a flattened, sleeker version of the bunkin taka shimada worn as a bridal wig in traditional weddings.
  Though geisha also wear this hairstyle as a wig, it is usually shaped specifically to their face by a wig stylist.
  Older geisha may wear the tsubushi taka shimada style on special occasions, featuring a flatter "bun" (mage) than both the bunkin taka shimada and chū taka shimada styles.
  Both the hairstyles of maiko and geisha are decorated with hair combs and hairpins (kanzashi), with geisha wearing far fewer kanzashi than maiko.
  The style and colour of hair accessories worn with some maiko hairstyles can signify the stage of an apprentice's training.
  Typical combs and hairpins may be made of tortoiseshell or mock-tortoiseshell, gold, silver and semi-precious stones such as jade and coral.

<p class="Makeuptxt">
  Oshiroi (白粉) is a powder foundation traditionally used by kabuki actors, geisha and their apprentices.
  The word oshiroi literally means "white powder", and is pronounced as the word for white (shiroi) with the honorific prefix o-.
  Geisha and maiko
  For both geisha and maiko, application of oshiroi varies by occasion, use, and sometimes region.
  Both geisha and maiko wear oshiroi on the face and neck, but application on the back of the neck differs per occasion.
  For most situations, a pattern known as eri-ashi (襟足, lit. 'neck stripes') is worn, forming two triangular stripes of unpainted skin from the nape of the neck downward.
  For formal occasions, a three-stripe pattern known as sanbon-ashi (三本足, lit. 'three pointed stripes') is used.
  Eri-ashi can be painted freehand with a smaller brush, but sanbon-ashi is generally painted using a stencil.
  Both geisha and maiko, whilst aiming for a white-faced appearance, do not use a heavy application of oshiroi unless worn for special performances, instead blending the foundation into the skin with the use of a blusher, known as tonoko.
  For geisha and maiko, application of oshiroi varies depending on age, status and region.
  Since the application of oshiroi can prove challenging, a younger maiko may have her okā-san ("mother" – typically the mother of the geisha house) or her "older sister" geisha mentor apply it for her at first.
  Younger apprentices may, in some regions, wear only oshiroi and blusher at the beginning of their apprenticeship to mark their inexperience, with the addition of black and red eyeliner at a later stage.
  Likewise, senior geisha tend not to wear any blusher, and wear oshiroi on fewer occasions over time, eventually wearing it only for special occasions and stage performances.
  The style of how a maiko wears oshiroi may also vary depending on the region of Japan an apprentice works in; in some districts, apprentices may only wear a light application of oshiroi, whereas in others, a heavier application is more common.
  Makeup styles may also vary in their use of blusher, red eyeliner and black eyeliner; this typically depends on both the inclinations of the mother of the house, and the general style of the geisha district.
