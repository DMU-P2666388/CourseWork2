  <p class="Par1">Japan (Japanese: 日本, Nippon or Nihon,[nb 1] and formally 日本国[nb 2]) is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the northwest Pacific Ocean, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan,
    while extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south.
    Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an archipelago of 6852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); the five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa.
    Tokyo is the nation's capital and largest city; other major cities include Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.

  Japan is the eleventh most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized.
  About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 125.5 million on narrow coastal plains.
  Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.

<p class="Par2">Japanese culture is very interesting and diverse. May people will automatically think of sushi, sumo, anime’s, or samurai’s when thinking of Japan, especially Western viewers.
Japanese people are very close to nature and have an immense respect for it.
Japan is roughly the size of California and has 130 million in population.
Japan is famous for the most futuristic technology and equipment, as well for bullet trains and sushi.
Among other ‘most Japanese things’, there are Anime’s, Chery Blossom festivals, Tea Ceremonies, the history of Geisha’s and Temples.
