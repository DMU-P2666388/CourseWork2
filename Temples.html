<p>Temples in Japan serve as spaces for meditation, rituals, remembrance, festivals and many more purposes.
  They vary in size and space, several covering large areas and each has a purpose of its own.
The history of Japan’s temples varies, but overall, it lies close to the history if Buddhism (introduced in the sixth century).
Over time, Buddhism split into five main sections – Tendai, Shingon, Pure Land, Zen and Nichiren.
Most temples belong to one of these sects, which define its purpose and use.
The most obvious object that demonstrates the sect of a temple is its main Buddha statue and other statues surrounding the Buddha.
Pure Land temples most often have an Amida Buddha statue, whereas other temples have a statue of Shakyamuni flanked by the founders of the sect represented in that temple.
Two temples do not belong to the five sects still in existence, and those are Tōdai-ji and Shitennō-ji.

Religion in Japan manifests primarily in Shinto and in Buddhism, the two main faiths, which Japanese people often practice simultaneously.
According to estimates, as many as 80% of the populace follow Shinto rituals to some degree, worshiping ancestors and spirits at domestic altars and public shrines.
An almost equally high number is reported as Buddhist.
Syncretic combinations of both, known generally as shinbutsu-shūgō, are common; they represented Japan's dominant religious practice before the rise of State Shinto in the 19th century.
