<p class="TeaText1">Japanese tea ceremony (known as sadō/chadō (茶道, "The Way of Tea") or cha-no-yu (茶の湯)) is a traditional form of tea ceremony and a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha (抹茶), powdered green tea, the art of which is called (o)temae ([お]手前/[お]点前)
Zen Buddhism was a primary influence in the development of the Japanese tea ceremony. Much less commonly, Japanese tea practice uses leaf tea, primarily sencha, a practice known as senchadō (煎茶道, "the way of sencha") in Japanese, as opposed to chanoyu or chadō.
Tea gatherings are classified as either an informal tea gathering (chakai (茶会, "tea gathering")) or a formal tea gathering (chaji (茶事, "tea event")).
A chakai is a relatively simple course of hospitality that includes confections, thin tea, and perhaps a light meal.
A chaji is a much more formal gathering, usually including a full-course kaiseki meal followed by confections, thick tea, and thin tea.
A chaji may last up to four hours.
Chadō is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with kōdō for incense appreciation, and kadō for flower arrangement.

  Japanese tea ceremonies are typically conducted in specially constructed spaces or rooms designed for the purpose of tea ceremony.
  While a purpose-built tatami-floored room is considered the ideal venue, any place where the necessary implements for the making and serving of the tea can be set out and where the host can make the tea in the presence of the seated guest(s) can be used as a venue for tea.
  For instance, a tea gathering can be held picnic-style in the outdoors, known as nodate (野点).
  A purpose-built room designed for the wabi style of tea is called a chashitsu, and is ideally 4.5-tatami wide and long in floor area.
  A purpose-built chashitsu typically has a low ceiling, a hearth built into the floor, an alcove for hanging scrolls and placing other decorative objects, and separate entrances for host and guests.
  It also has an attached preparation area known as a mizuya.
  A 4.5-mat room is considered standard, but smaller and larger rooms are also used.
  Building materials and decorations are deliberately simple and rustic in wabi style tea rooms.
  Chashitsu can also refer to free-standing buildings for tea.
  Known in English as tea houses, such structures may contain several tea rooms of different sizes and styles, dressing and waiting rooms, and other amenities, and be surrounded by a tea garden called a roji.

  The equipment for tea ceremony is called chadōgu (茶道具).
  A wide range of chadōgu are available and different styles and motifs are used for different events and in different seasons, with most being constructed from carefully crafted bamboo.
  All the tools for tea are handled with exquisite care, being scrupulously cleaned before and after each use and before storing, with some handled only with gloved hands.
  Some items, such as the tea storage jar (known as "chigusa"), are so revered, that historically, they were given proper names like people, and were admired and documented by multiple diarists.
  Some of the more essential components of tea ceremony are:
<ul class="TeaList1">
  <li><b>Chakin</b> (茶巾)
  <br>
The chakin is a small rectangular white linen or hemp cloth mainly used to wipe the tea bowl.</li>
<li><b>Tea bowl</b> (茶碗, chawan)
<br>
Tea bowls are available in a wide range of sizes and styles, and different styles are used for thick and thin tea.
Shallow bowls, which allow the tea to cool rapidly, are used in summer; deep bowls are used in winter.
Bowls are frequently named by their creators or owners, or by a tea master.
Bowls over four hundred years old are in use today, but only on unusually special occasions.
The best bowls are thrown by hand, and some bowls are extremely valuable. Irregularities and imperfections are prized: they are often featured prominently as the "front" of the bowl.
</li>
<li><b>Tea caddy</b> (棗・茶入, Natsume/Chaire)
<br>
The small lidded container in which the powdered tea is placed for use in the tea-making procedure ([お]手前; [お]点前; [御]手前, [o]temae).</li>
<li><b>Tea scoop</b> (茶杓, chashaku)
<br>
Tea scoops generally are carved from a single piece of bamboo, although they may also be made of ivory or wood.
They are used to scoop tea from the tea caddy into the tea bowl.
Bamboo tea scoops in the most casual style have a nodule in the approximate center.
Larger scoops are used to transfer tea into the tea caddy in the mizuya (preparation area), but these are not seen by guests.
Different styles and colours are used in various tea traditions.
</li>
<li><b>Tea whisk</b> (茶筅, chasen)
<br>
This is the implement used to mix the powdered tea with the hot water.
Tea whisks are carved from a single piece of bamboo.
There are various types.
Tea whisks quickly become worn and damaged with use, and the host should use a new one when holding a chakai or chaji.
</li>
</ul>
